# Note to visitors

Hey there.

I am slowly moving away from GitHub because of concerns with Microsoft and nonfree JavaScript.  Please refer to my website to see what I'm working on; the navbar contains links to my projects and git site.

I intend to keep this account to collaborate with others on projects on GitHub.

Check out [GitLab](https://gitlab.com), [Gitea](https://gitea.io), [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org), and [Noteabug](https://notabug.org).

Thank you.
